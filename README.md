# Alarmify


As a developers and as a manager we want to keep notified when one of our websites or services are donw, great examples of this is pingdom. 

This project is a simpler open source alternative to pingdom 



## Technology

I started the project in Laravel 8.0 trying to follow the TDD principle, but that is almost imposible due to some Architecture limitaiton of the Framework, but that's ok. 

The whole idea was create a monolotic simple solution using the great integration of VueJs with PHP that laravel provide. 


## Requirements

* PHP > 8.x
* MySql 
* Redis


## Configuration

For Mac developers using Valet as a service is great, for productive environments I will detail it later.
